# bogus-to-triviatime

This is a script to parse the `t2.users` file found in BogusTrivia and generate an SQLite statement so that the scores can be migrated into the TriviaTime script.

This script is being created for the `#trivia` channel on irc.snoonet.org and may not necessarily be optimised for general usage.
